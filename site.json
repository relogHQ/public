			"message": "Enrolling in this course was one of the best decisions I have taken in my life. As the name suggests this truly is a 'Masterclass'. The content is crisp, very engaging and the discussions are fun and of very high quality. The breadth and depth of topics covered would definitely help in work as well as interviews. I had the chance to take few 1:1 mentorship sessions as well and collected some valuable wisdom from those sessions. Very few courses out there leave such an impact and this one definitely made me a better engineer. And the cherry on top - I was able to crack SDE 2 interview at Coinbase :)",
