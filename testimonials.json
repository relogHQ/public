There are so many systems that we take for granted and don't look into - load balancers , cloud storages, database engines etc. even though they're often the ones doing the heavy lifting in enterprise applications. Arpit provides great insight into why things are the way they are and also introduces some neat spinoffs! Completely worth both the time and money!",

Arpit is delivering his years of experience and research in this course. At start of course, even after reading/watching so many resources , I wasn't sure of system design. By the end of this course I have already started implementing system design's lego blocks and have so many  ideas which i want to implement and test myself.",

The topics covered in class were non-trivial but were introduced perfectly like they were lego blocks - smaller components adding up to bigger and better systems. What sets this masterclass apart is the focus on designing systems the way a real company would do (think companies you admire, eg FANG). This is a course that'll improve your design thinking, empower you to ask the right questions and help you make the right tradeoffs for your system. Highly recommend!",

Arpit is an expert Technologist and has obviously put a lot of thought and expertise into designing the course. But it wasn’t just about the knowledge. Additional benefits came from doing assignments, receiving individual feedback and interacting with Arpit and other participants. My perspective has been changed in the way I look at Systems now. I didn’t just learn \"how\" to design systems – \"what\" and \"why\" also became much clearer. Investment of time, effort and money on this course is a value add to my skills and it made me a better Software Engineer!",

Arpit made the sessions beautiful with all the experience he had in building large scale systems. 1. Loved the brainstorming sessions that happened for an application and pros and cons discussion of every decision by an individual done by Arpit is really Good. 2. Some sessions are like iterative building blocks of an app from scratch is eye opener on many concepts. ex: building  word dictionary. 3.Its not bounded only to curriculum mentioned but new system designs has come into picture and session went for 3hrs.

I had the chance to take few 1:1 mentorship sessions as well and collected some valuable wisdom from those sessions. Very few courses out there leave such an impact and this one definitely made me a better engineer. And the cherry on top - I was able to crack SDE 2 interview at Coinbase :)",

The one best thing about the course is the cohort based approach which ignites discussion when different people dives into with their real world experiences and pitches in their solutions, adding more depth to every system design. Even if someone has watched all the system design videos out there, there would be moments of amazement and would help connect the dots to various pieces of puzzles out there in production systems. The final cheery on top is the Mentorship session which Arpit provides for any abstract discussions outside the course content as well. Its was not just about learning designing a 'xyz' system but to build an intuition, and the building blocks needed to tackle a problem statement one might come across leveraging the content and experience which Arpit provides and eventually target to be a better Software Engineer.",
